I'm a PhD student in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am advised by [Duncan Watts](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/duncan-j-watts-phd) and [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/) and am part of the [CSSLab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/) and [PennNLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/). My research interests are in computational social science and natural language processing.

Before coming to Penn, I received my MS in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, where I was a [Fulbright Scholar](https://eca.state.gov/fulbright/about-fulbright/fulbright-program-overview) and worked with [Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/) and [Nanyun Peng](https://violetpeng.github.io/) at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://isi.edu/). I also served as President of [GRIDS](https://gridsusc.github.io/), USC's student data science community.

I received my BSc, also in Computer Science, from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, and spent a couple of years building natural language processing systems for Urdu at its Center for Language Engineering.
